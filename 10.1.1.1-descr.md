TomasKindahl: Describe the content of this file!

GitHub Copilot: This file (intmath.py) contains several mathematical utility functions implemented in Python. Hereâ€™s a summary of its contents:

- **isprime(n):** Checks if an integer `n` is a prime number.
- **nextprime(n):** Finds the next prime number greater than `n`.
- **primefactors(n):** Returns the list of prime factors of `n`.
- **power(c, n):** Computes `c` raised to the power `n`, handling both integer and non-integer exponents.
- **factorial(n):** Calculates the factorial of `n` using memoization for efficiency.
- **fibbonacci(n):** Computes the nth Fibonacci number using memoization (note: spelling should be "fibonacci").
- **combination(n, k):** Calculates the binomial coefficient ("n choose k") using recursion.

The file uses memoization for factorial and Fibonacci calculations to optimize repeated calls. The code is written in a functional style, with each function performing a specific mathematical task.
